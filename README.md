# Simple Perl-like Language
This is a little project for my Progamming Language Concepts class.

## What can it do?
Not much, but here is some of the features:
  - Able to perform simple arithmetic operations. (Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, Division)
  - Two types of variables, numeric and string.
  - Has string concatenation and string relational operators. (-eq, -lt, -gt)
  - Has numeric exponent operation and numeric relational operators.
  - IF statement along with an optional else statement.

## What can it not do?
Alot, but here's a few limitations:
 - There are no classes or functions.
 - There is no cast operation, only implicit casts between numeric double and integer.
 - No recursion is available, neither while loops or for loops.
